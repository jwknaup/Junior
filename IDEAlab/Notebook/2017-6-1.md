SpringK = 110 w/ mu = 5.5 & ml = 1.2 & g=9.81 & d0=2.5 & h = 3cm
k = 1.67*w
or 85=k with 6damping, so k = 1.29*w
results pretty consistent (very w/out damper) (eh, very w/ too) bu decreasing mass and spring by 1 & 2 orders of mag
messing w/ gravity jacks everything up, slowing time helps
scaled lengths by 100, g by 100, sleep thresh by 100, & bounce & contact offset by 10; reduce times by 10
so now 1 cm = 1 m, g = 981, 10^-1 kg = 1 kg k = 1100
OR 1kg  = 1kg and k = 110


SpringK = 200 w/ mu = .055 & ml = .012 & g=981 & d0=2.5 & h = 3in (7.6cm), no damping
1300 w/ damper of 10 and mass scaled up to .12 & .55, with this time can be 1 & .001, .002, .003
Results in deflection of .4 (16%) at rest
