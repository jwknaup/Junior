matlab optimiation results in ~150 rpm higher max than unity for same moment arm & ~1cm higher subtracted jump height
Measurement standards
 - jump height per mass "A Miniature Jumping Robot with Self-Recovery Capabilities"
 - jump height per mass "Basic Performance Experiments for Jumping Quadruped "
 - jump height per leg length and mass "MultiMo-Bat: A biologically inspired integrated jumpingâ€“gliding robot"
add changing theta and start planning experimental setup
