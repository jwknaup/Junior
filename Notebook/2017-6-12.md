  - tail driven, passive spring legs
  - control rotation of leg for forward
  - 1.6 leg lengths hop height (+.6 above)
  - kangaroo rat
  - "four decoupled 1DOF base controllers"
  - tail balances body orientation in air

  - Peak power density376 W/Kg, Peak (vertical) force density 46 N/Kg

Decisions
  Spring
  - springK = 1600 w/ damper 10 ad masses of scale .1 (kg*10^-1) and cm and g=981
  - Therefore, 1800 (kg * 10^-1)*cm/s^2/cm = 1800 (kg*10^1)/s^2 = 180 kg/s^2 = 180 N/m
  - each spring in device experiences 50-100% of collision force -> transmission reduction of 1:1 to 1:2 during contact
  Balancing
  - 3.5 cm between masses to balance from 30 deg
